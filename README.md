splunk-hello-world-xamarin-forms
================================
Super simple hello world using the [Splunk C# SDK] (http://dev.splunk.com/view/csharp-sdk/SP-CAAAEPK) and Reactive Extensions (Rx) in Xamarin Forms.

# Pre-requisites
* To use the Splunk SDK on Xamarin Forms currently requires our daily build of our SDK off of MyGet. In Xamarin Studio, add our MyGet feed to your package sources: https://splunk.myget.org/F/splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl/
* You need a Splunk instance which you can access.

# Setup
In the App.cs file change the logon settings to your Splunk Server host, port and credentials.
